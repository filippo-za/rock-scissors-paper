## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I tried to carry out this Front End Mentor challenge in the best possible way. On this site you can find many projects to be carried out to improve your skills.
Below is the link: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges

## The challenge

The application was created with html, css, java script and react

Your challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser _(optional)_

### Rules

If the player wins, they gain 1 point. If the computer wins, the player loses one point.

#### Original

- Paper beats Rock
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
